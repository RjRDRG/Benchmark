# In Artillery, each VU will be assigned to one of the defined
# scenarios. By default, each scenario has a weight of 1, meaning
# each scenario has the same probability of getting assigned to a
# VU.
#
# By specifying a weight in a scenario, you'll increase the chances
# of Artillery assigning the scenario for a VU. The probability of
# a scenario getting chosen depends on the total weight for all
# scenarios.
#
# To learn more, read the Artillery documentation on scenario weights:
